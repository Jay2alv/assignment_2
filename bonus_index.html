<h2>September 4th, 2025</h2> 

<article style="background-color: aquamarine;">Welcome to my sports page, here I will talk about sports news.
    We just had many games across the MLB to the first NFL game of the year.
    Cowboys came up the losers in this tight nail biting game against the Eagles. Jalen Hurts was on a roll and Cowboys defense didn't have a solution.
    Many MLB games were played as Dodgers continue there downhill second half with another loss against the Pirates.
    Will keep you updated with more shortly...
